			 <p>“I’m a realist — I can look at the world and see exactly what it is. Every great love story ends in tragedy: You die,” Clooney says. “But I’m always optimistic that sooner or later we’re going to get these things right. It’s going to take a lot of effort and we’re not going to see all of it in our lifetime. But that’s part of our job, to keep rolling that ball up the hill.”</p>

			 <p>This might be the best headline I read this year, “It began on a gold escalator. It may have ended at Four Seasons Total Landscaping.” The level of incompetence while trying to defend his presidency checks out after witnessing his management of the pandemic.  The former would send me into fits of laughter if not for the death that surrounds us. I’m just glad it is over. Well, almost over.</p>

			 <p>The time I like is the rush hour, &lsquo;cause I like the rush<br />
The pushing of the people - I like it all so much<br />
Such a mass of motion - do not know where it goes<br />
I move with the movement and&hellip; I have the touch</p>

<p>I’m awaiting for ignition, I&rsquo;m looking for a spark<br />
Any chance collision and I light up in the dark<br />
There you stand before me, all that fur and all that hair<br />
Oh do I dare&hellip;I have the touch</p>

			 <p>This week I was reminded how much I love to write.  I spent a few hours over several days writing about change and technical processes and things that I hope are transformational.  As a result, it took time to write, edit, and rewrite, and I was reminded just how much I love that process.  The way that the mind keeps grasping for just the right sentence, or a particular turn of phrase that layers in just that one little missing piece of meaning, or context for others to discover — not unlike a cook reaching into her spice cabinet for just a hint of something that makes the sauce, I find the delight when the world opens up and the right words are revealed to me when I write.</p>

<p>Truth is, in software, I have been writing about the same problems over and over, but it changes a little as I go into a new domain with new people that are trying to solve the same basic issues.  So here I am again writing about the same old problems but with an emphasis on this note, or that particular spice if you like, and that is where I found my joy.  — OR —  Or perhaps this is part of fighting boredom as I age, finding new and exciting ways in the practical application of experience. I guess it could be either one. :-)</p>

			 <p>You know when you&rsquo;re stuck at a light, the kind where if the second or third car in front of you is on it, you&rsquo;ll make it, but if they&rsquo;re not on their game, you won&rsquo;t? I’ve always found these situations vexing, especially when I don’t make it and wind up as the first car at the new light.  Well the other week my wife was driving and suffered one of those situations and instead of getting upset, do you what she did?  She flipped her hand like a magic wand at the situation pulling away from us and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just let that all go, and get a fresh one, start over.”  I burst out laughing because it was so surprising, &ldquo;Get a fresh one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s was so delightful I tried this myself and it&rsquo;s become part of the way I drive now.  My daily drive is full of construction at the moment with plenty of built in frustrating delays. But now instead of stewing, anytime I am first in line waiting for my turn, I just wave it away and say the magic words, “I’ll just get a fresh one.”  I know I may look silly waving my hand and smiling like I do, but it feels good.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>To end this year I am memorializing my father.  I gave his tribute on December 1st, kicking off what is normally one of my favorite times of the year, that sweet spot between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve. This one was marked by his passing and was bittersweet.  The weeks since have been spent taking care of my mom and tending to the business of modifying her life for the future.  As a result, the month of December has flown by with little time to process the loss myself, and I want to take some time to correct that and write some of it down.  It’s not the usual blog fare, but it’s all I got.</p>

<p>My dad checked into the hospital on November 17th, celebrated his 59th wedding anniversary on the 21st, Thanksgiving on the 22nd, and died on the 24th, having never left.  His death is what anyone could want in a passing, something rapid without any lingering agony.  It was so fast that I was not able to be there for the end.  I find that both a little sad and a little merciful in equal measure.  There are some memories I don’t need and that is probably one of them. My journey home took me through Orlando and all I remember is how surreal it was to be traveling in a state of shock with people on their way to Disney for Christmas.  The days leading up to his funeral were a blur, and I had little time to prepare myself.  I wrote somethings down during my trip, but the words were so disjointed I found that I couldn’t use them.  Instead, I made a little outline and used it to speak from the heart.  I can’t remember exactly what I said now, but parts of it are here.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to consider my dad a close friend.  We came of age at approximately the same time.  I know that sounds odd, but you see my dad joined The Program (AA) when he was 40 and I was a teenager.  He was growing and maturing into the man he became during the second half of his life during my formative years in high school.  The fondest memories of my time with him are of being his garage working on an old Triumph TR-6 roadster, the car that I would take to college, and all the conversations we would have there, while the smells of oil, transmission fluid, and night blooming jasmine, surrounded us in South Florida.  Our conversations were intimate and often filled with humor.  Today the relationship I’m fostering with my son is informed by that experience.</p>

<p>One of my favorite moments, happened when he was trying to remove the cover to a break fluid reservoir.  The reservoir itself was rectangular and made of a plastic resin.  The cap was flat and roughly the size of a man’s palm.  My father struggled for minutes trying to unscrew the cap and became angry and frustrated, and cursed in some usual way.  I had been studying this while he fumed and said, “Let me try.” He looked at me with a disbelieving eye and threw his hands up.  My hands are bigger than his were so right then and there I reached over, and in one single motion simply removed the cap.  Dead silence.  He looked over at me and said, “You got to be kiddin’ me.”  To which I replied, “It’s not my fault if you want to do everything the hard way.”  He stared at me, and I stared right back at him, and we held it for a beat or two, then we simply burst into laughter.  That was the moment he and I became friends.</p>

<p>In college, I would recall many events in that garage and the conversations that would define my father to me. I learned a lot about him over the years. And among moments of laughter were also moments of sock at some of the things he had endured in his life.</p>

<p>When you restore old cars you have to take care while taking them apart because, obviously, you hope to put them back together one day.  On one occasion my dad was using a hammer and accidentally bent part of a door assembly, which would make it more difficult to reassemble.  I was on the other side of the car performing another task, and I heard the THWACK of the hammer followed by a guttural whispered voice, “YOU GODDAMN DUMMY.”  “What?” I called.  “Oh nothing.” He said in frustration, “That’s just my father.”  I heard this repeatedly over the life of the restoration project.</p>

<p>One time, he fell back and sat after a visit from his father’s ghost, and I said, “He really did a number on you. Didn’t he?”  My dad acknowledged this by telling me a story involving his pet rabbit, which his father made him kill for a family dinner.  (You read that right.)  And you also have to understand that my father’s family were not without means or the ability to purchase one in the market.  No, it was done with a measure of malice and cruelty to teach him a lesson.   I remember vividly, how, with his eyes closed, my dad clawed at the bend in his arm with his opposite hand, as he relived it to me - feeling the rabbit’s feet flailing on his arm, while he was trying, and failing, to kill his cherished pet as quickly and humanely as a young boy could. (Horrifyingly, it finally ended with a hammer.)  From that moment on the memory was cast as I contemplated a cruelty I could never imagine, and never experienced in my own life, thanks to him.</p>

<p>I still marvel at how he was able to put a story like that behind him and name his first born son after his father.  I see him in a very poignant way, both in terms of the perseverance it took to get away from, and the desire to still gain approval from, his father.  It is little wonder that he was an alcoholic.  Nevertheless, his life became one of success and redemption.  At 40, he quit drinking and remained sober for the rest of his life.  He thrived as a mechanical engineer and authored two patents for Pratt &amp; Whitney where he worked until he retired.</p>

<p>Despite his accomplishments, my father was without ego and learned very slowly how to enjoy his life, because his father’s ghost was never that far away.  He found a lot of purpose in sponsoring other men in Alcoholics Anonymous and I saw proof of this at his funeral when I met more people than I could count, who told me how much they appreciated him.  I think one of the things that helped him succeed was his background, and why he always said he wouldn’t change a thing.  It grounded him in some way I can’t fully describe, but I can say I had a lot of fun teasing him about all his toys.  I used to say he had &ldquo;good problems&rdquo; trying to decide wether to go out on boat, go for a drive, or just hang out by the pool. He might chuckle to be polite, but these things never meant much to him.  What mattered to him were the people in his life and he would talk about their struggles and their successes with more pride than his own.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I called home every Sunday morning and he would share their stories and what was going on. The common theme was always work. “Work on what is in front of you,” is what he would recall - a lesson he was taught, and in the process it installed within me a work ethic and an appreciation for his simple admonition.  “Work the the problem, treat others with respect, the rest will take care of itself.”  His mantra became my own.</p>

<p>My father enjoyed almost 20 years in retirement.  He loved where he lived, and the last time we spoke he said that he didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him.  “I loved my life. It was great!” It’s one of the last things he said to me in the days before he died.  The memory of the timbre of his voice and the sense of wonder in it as he said goodbye is one that I cherish now.</p>

<p>It is not easy to say goodbye to him.  It has impacted me a lot more than I ever expected and it made speaking about him difficult at his funeral.  My father was 81 so it is difficult to say it was unexpected because it was his time.  In the end, what mattered to him most were people and I like that very much.  While he was never good at expressing it, he loved people deeply, but always in that gruff old school kind of way. Again, I saw proof of this when I thanked all the people that showed up for his service.  To do this, I closed my tribute by summoning a bit of his spirit and said,  “My dad would be overwhelmed that so many of you showed up for him. And I know exactly what he would say, ‘Jesus Christ, Jackie! How the hell are we gonna feed all these people?!’”  And the room exploded in laughter in recognition.</p>

<p>In the end as large as the auditorium was, it wasn’t large enough to hold all of the people that came for my dad.  More people than we had ever talked about gathered to fill it, and even more came to stand in the back and peek in from the doors.  I have never spoken in front of so many people in my life.  When it was over and my mom got up to go, she looked back with teary eyes and whispered to him, “Standing room only, Jack.”</p>

<p>As I said before, my dad had good problems.</p>
